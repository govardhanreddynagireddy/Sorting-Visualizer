# 🔢 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer (Python)

An interactive **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** built using **Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib animations**.
This project dynamically visualizes how popular sorting algorithms work step-by-step.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🔁 Dynamic selection of sorting algorithms at runtime
* 📊 Real-time bar chart animation using Matplotlib
* 🧠 Algorithm logic separated from visualization
* ⚡ Optimized Bubble Sort (early stopping)
* 📈 Easy to extend with new algorithms

## 🧮 Supported Algorithms

| Algorithm      | Time Complexity | Stable | In-Place |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------ | -------- |
| Bubble Sort    | O(n²)           | ✅ Yes  | ✅ Yes    |
| Selection Sort | O(n²)           | ❌ No   | ✅ Yes    |
| Insertion Sort | O(n²)           | ✅ Yes  | ✅ Yes    |

## 🖥️ Demo (How It Works)

1. Run the program
2. Choose a sorting algorithm from the menu:

   ```
   1. Bubble Sort
   2. Selection Sort
   3. Insertion Sort
   ```
3. Watch the algorithm sort the array visually step-by-step

Each bar represents an element in the array, and its height corresponds to its value.
